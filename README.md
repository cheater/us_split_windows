us_split_v3
a Windows keyboard layout


ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

A keyboard layout for Windows. Geared specifically towards reducing RSI, this
layout is nearly identical to US-QWERTY, except there is a two-key split
between the T and Y columns into which symbols from the furthest right of
each row are placed. The hands can assume a more natural position two key
columns wider apart (similarly as with Dvorak) and hitting Enter is not an
exercise for contortionists any longer.

One of the problems with US-QWERTY is that the palm of the right hand needs
to move a lot -- especially bending in the wrist -- which can then lead to
Repetitive Strain Injury. If you spend a lot of time typing, you should be
aware of this, and should know that you might be hurting yourself with an
inappropriate keyboard layout. This layout makes it easy for people to try
out something new while mitigating many important issues.

The changes can be seen easily at the diagrams below:

Normal US-QWERTY:

    Esc  F1 ... F12

     ` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = BBBB
    Tab q w e r t y u i o p [ ] RRR
    Caps a s d f g h j k l ; ' \ RR
    SS  < z x c v b n m , . / SSSSS
    CCC W AAA __________ AA MM CCCC


This layout:

    Esc  F1 ... F12

     ` 1 2 3 4 5 - = 6 7 8 9 0 BBBB
    Tab q w e r t [ ] y u i o p RRR
    Caps a s d f g \ ' h j k l ; RR
    SS L3 z x c v , . b n m / SSSSS
    CCC W AAA __________ AA AA CCCC

The shorthands are:

    S = Shift
    C = Control
    A = Alt
    W = Win key (Super key)
    M = Menu key
    R = Return key (Enter key)
    B = Backspace key
    _ = Space key
    L3 = ISO Level3 Shift (Alt Gr)

The symbol keys, which do not get typed very often, have been placed in the
middle. This is analogous to them being out of the reach of the right hand in
its normal position on the US QWERTY keyboard, except that this time they are
accessed using the much more dexterous index finger. Additionally, they are
shared with the left index finger, which as a practical outcome means that
the palms of the hand need to travel less and can in fact stay in their home
position most of the time, as most keys can be accessed by reaching out the
fingers. Additionally, this action of reaching out the fingers is completely
opposite to the movements that cause RSI, and stretches the muscle and
ligaments that get damaged by non-ergonomic layouts.

The symbol keys have been moved because in the US QWERTY layout they increase
the distance the right palm needs to travel in order for the typist to press
Backspace and Enter, which are very important and frequently typed keys. As
it is, the US QWERTY layout develops a habit in its users where they jerk the
palm of the right hand to the right after every finished sentence, creating a
very fast pathway towards RSI. There have been attempts to solve the problem
by using smaller keys for the right-hand-side symbols, as well as by making
the enter key bigger. Some of them have been partly successful, however none
of them was fixing the problem at its source, which is an inadequate layout.


INSTALLATION

Use the provided installer in the releases page for this repository, or
build your own from the source .kbd file by using the Microsoft Keyboard
Layout Creator 1.4.


USAGE

This layout can be used via the Windows Control Panel.

If you use multiple US English keyboard layouts, under Windows 10, make sure
to go to the Language Preferences in the Control Panel, then go to Keyboard,
and use the dropdown in the first section, named "Override for default input
method", to select this layout.


STABILITY

The layout may change (even drastically!) in the future. Older versions
should be available from the usual sources.
